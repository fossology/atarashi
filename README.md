# Atarashi

Open source software is licensed using open source licenses. There are many
of open source licenses around and adding to that, open source software
packages involve sometimes multiple licenses for different files.

Atarashi provides different methods for scanning for license statements in
open source software. Unlike existing rule-based approaches - such as the
Nomos license scanner from the FOSSology project - atarashi implements multiple
text statistics and information retrieval algorithms.

Anticipated advantages is an improved precision while offering an as easy
as possible approach to add new license texts or new license references.

Atarashi is designed to work stand-alone and with FOSSology. More info at

- Running **tfidf** agent
    - With **Cosine similarity**

        `atarashi -a tfidf /path/to/file.c`

        `atarashi -a tfidf -s CosineSim /path/to/file.c`
    - With **Score similarity**

        `atarashi -a tfidf -s ScoreSim /path/to/file.c`
- Running **Ngram** agent
    - With **Cosine similarity**

        `atarashi -a Ngram /path/to/file.c`

        `atarashi -a Ngram -s CosineSim /path/to/file.c`
    - With **Dice similarity**

        `atarashi -a Ngram -s DiceSim /path/to/file.c`
    - With **Bigram Cosine similarity**

        `atarashi -a Ngram -s BigramCosineSim /path/to/file.c`
- Running in **verbose** mode

    `atarashi -a DLD -v /path/to/file.c`
- Running with custom CSVs and JSONs
    - Please reffer to the build instructions to get the CSV and JSON
    understandable by atarashi.
    - `atarashi -a DLD -l /path/to/processedList.csv /path/to/file.c`
    - `atarashi -a Ngram -l /path/to/processedList.csv -j /path/to/ngram.json /path/to/file.c`


### Test

- Run imtihaan (meaning *Exam* in Hindi) with the name of the Agent.
- eg. `python atarashi/imtihaan.py /path/to/processedList.csv <DLD|tfidf|Ngram> <testfile>`
- See `python atarashi/imtihaan.py --help` for more
