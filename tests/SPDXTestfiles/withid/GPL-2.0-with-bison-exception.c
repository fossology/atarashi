Bison Exception

As a special exception, you may create a larger work
that contains part or all of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute
that work under terms of your choice, so long as that work isn't
itself a parser generator using the skeleton or a modified version
thereof as a parser skeleton. Alternatively, if you modify or
redistribute the parser skeleton itself, you may (at your option)
remove this special exception, which will cause the skeleton and the
resulting Bison output files to be licensed under the GNU General
Public License without this special exception.

This special exception
was added by the Free Software Foundation in version 2.2 of Bison.
