'''Python Module to classify license using Damerau Levenshtein distance algorithm
Input: File from which license needs to be scanned and license list (CSV)
Output: License which is contained in the file.
Description: It extract comments from the file and after preprocessing,
              it calculates the damerau_levenshtein_distance and then classify
              by finding the leadt distance.
